A project built to minimize the efforts required to fight against human trafficing.
This is a project built on top of spring framework which acts as the back-end and angular-js which is used for developing and organizing front-end.
The basic goal of the project is to reduce gap between citizens, NGO's and Police department by bringing all to single platform which internally takes care of routing an issue filed by a citizen to the closest available NGO and police department.
The NGO and the police department can then start working on the complains and if found legit can proceed with further investigation.
A person who has logged the complaint can see which the NGO and the police department are currently working on the case and also can see the status of their complain meaning if it is completed or in progress.
Logging in as an NGO/Police department can give you the whole view of which cases are currently being handled and which have been solved along with having the number of people who were saved from trafficking.
Thus reducing the efforts a person has to go through to logged a complaint and then take the same information and bring an NGO too into the work.
The hand-in-hand collaboration of NGO and police department will result into faster progress in the case.
